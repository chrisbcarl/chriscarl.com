Incredibly simple website that just gets the point across, but it DOES look cool.

**NOTE:** the original angular implementation is tucked away in tag `refs/tags/2018-angular`.


# Development and Strategy
- Illustration by [Matt](mailto:Mgz1619@gmail.com) &copy; 2018 was conducted in OneNote with a Surface Book 2 laptop and Surface Pen.
- Select all drawings, paste in Adobe Illustrator (this way the brush strokes are registered in order rather than as some optimized mess of beziers)
- Save as SVG
- Develop [a script](./scripts/svg-to-js-test.py) to extract the individual paths, save those as a JSON
- play back the paths one by one by appending a new element to an svg canvas in the [index.html](./src/index.html). Its that stupid.
