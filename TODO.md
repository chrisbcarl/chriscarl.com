# TODO
- live display of internet traffic "legitimate" compared to "illegitimate" usage, typical clients, usual attack vectors, frequency, country access, amount of times the actual content in the website is accessed, etc.
    - ooooooh.... quick machine learning project + internet security. access logs alone. process the access logs, add a feature with how far apart each request is from its neighbor, just cluster or classify real and fake requests! interesting... from there you can just "deploy an ml model" on disk and have it running.
- favicon...
- ssl cert...
- add email icon, maybe sjsu email as well
- links to major projects?
- blog?
- cron job to pull and move, and if failed, send email?
- cron job on launch, launch cmatrix to get some cpu action going
